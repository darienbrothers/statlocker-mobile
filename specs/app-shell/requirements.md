# Mobile App Shell Requirements

## Introduction

The Mobile App Shell provides the foundational structure and navigation framework for the StatLocker mobile application. It establishes the core layout patterns, navigation structure, theming system, and reusable components that will be used throughout the application. This shell serves as the foundation upon which all other features (onboarding, dashboard, game logging, etc.) will be built.

## Glossary

- **App Shell**: The foundational structure and navigation framework of the mobile application
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing system for React Native applications using Expo
- **Route Groups**: Organizational structure in Expo Router using parentheses to group related routes
- **NativeWind**: Tailwind CSS implementation for React Native styling
- **Design Tokens**: Standardized design values (colors, spacing, typography) used consistently across the app
- **Screen Component**: Reusable layout component that provides consistent structure for all app screens
- **CTA Component**: Call-to-Action component for primary user actions, typically positioned at the bottom of screens
- **Safe Areas**: Screen regions that avoid system UI elements like status bars and home indicators
- **Auth Gate**: Initial loading screen that waits for authentication state resolution before routing
- **UI Kit Atoms**: Basic reusable UI components that form the foundation of the design system
- **Haptics**: Tactile feedback provided through device vibration for user interactions
- **Error Boundary**: React component that catches JavaScript errors and displays fallback UI
- **Analytics Adapter**: Service layer for tracking user interactions and screen views
- **Path Alias**: TypeScript/bundler configuration that allows shorter import paths
