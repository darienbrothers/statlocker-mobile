# Authentication Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication System enables secure user access to StatLocker through multiple sign-in methods including Apple Sign-In, Google Sign-In, and Email/Password authentication. The system manages user sessions, handles authentication state persistence, and provides secure routing between authenticated and unauthenticated areas of the application.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The Firebase Auth-based system that manages user identity verification and session management
- **User_Session**: An authenticated state that persists across app launches and includes user credentials and tokens
- **Sign_In_Provider**: A third-party authentication service (Apple, Google) or native email/password system
- **Auth_State**: The current authentication status of a user (authenticated, unauthenticated, loading)
- **Rate_Limiting**: Security mechanism that prevents excessive authentication attempts within a time window
- **Session_Persistence**: The ability to maintain user authentication across app restarts and device reboots
