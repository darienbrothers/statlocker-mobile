# Firebase Authentication Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the Firebase Authentication setup completed as part of Task 1 of the authentication implementation plan.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- ✅ Created `src/lib/firebase.ts` with environment-specific Firebase configuration
- ✅ Added support for development, staging, and production environments
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling and validation for Firebase config
- ✅ Added Firebase initialization with automatic persistence

### 2. Dependencies Installed
- ✅ `firebase` - Core Firebase SDK
- ✅ `expo-auth-session` - OAuth authentication flows
- ✅ `expo-crypto` - Cryptographic utilities for secure authentication
- ✅ `expo-secure-store` - Secure storage for authentication tokens
- ✅ `expo-apple-authentication` - Apple Sign-In integration
- ✅ `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` - Google Sign-In integration

### 3. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Updated `.env.example` with Firebase configuration templates
- ✅ Added environment-specific Firebase configs (dev, staging, prod)
- ✅ Updated `app.json` with necessary plugins and configuration

### 4. Authentication Service
- ✅ Created `src/services/AuthService.ts` with Firebase Auth integration
- ✅ Implemented email/password authentication methods
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Created TypeScript interfaces for User, AuthError, and AuthProvider

### 5. Authentication Store
- ✅ Updated `src/store/authStore.ts` to integrate with Firebase Auth
- ✅ Added Zustand store with persistence for authentication state
- ✅ Implemented sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, and password reset methods
- ✅ Added proper error handling and loading states

### 6. App Integration
- ✅ Updated root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`) to initialize Firebase
- ✅ Added proper logging and error handling for initialization
- ✅ Integrated Firebase initialization with existing app startup flow

## Configuration Required

To complete the setup, you need to:

1. **Create Firebase Projects**
   - Development: `statlocker-dev`
   - Staging: `statlocker-staging` 
   - Production: `statlocker-prod`

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   Replace the placeholder values in `.env.development` and `.env.production` with actual Firebase configuration values from your Firebase console.

3. **Configure Authentication Providers**
   - Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
   - Set up Apple Sign-In (will be configured in Task 14.1)
   - Set up Google Sign-In (will be configured in Task 14.2)

## Next Steps

The core Firebase Auth infrastructure is now in place. The next tasks will:

- Task 2: Create comprehensive TypeScript types and interfaces
- Task 3: Implement provider-specific authentication (Apple, Google)
- Task 4: Set up Zustand state management with session persistence
- Task 5: Build UI components for authentication screens

## Verification

To verify the setup is working:

1. Ensure TypeScript compilation passes: `npm run type-check`
2. Start the development server: `npm start`
3. The app should initialize Firebase without errors (check logs)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase configuration and initialization
- `src/services/AuthService.ts` - Authentication service with Firebase integration
- `docs/firebase-setup.md` - This documentation file

### Modified Files
- `src/lib/index.ts` - Added Firebase exports
- `src/services/index.ts` - Added AuthService exports
- `src/store/authStore.ts` - Integrated with Firebase Auth
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Added Firebase initialization
- `.env.example` - Added Firebase configuration templates
- `.env.development` - Added development Firebase config
- `.env.production` - Added production Firebase config placeholders
- `app.json` - Added authentication plugins and configuration
- `package.json` - Added Firebase and authentication dependencies

## Security Notes

- Firebase configuration values are safe to expose in client-side code
- Sensitive operations are protected by Firebase Security Rules (to be configured)
- Authentication tokens are automatically managed by Firebase SDK
- Secure storage is used for session persistence via expo-secure-store
